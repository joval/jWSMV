BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR jWSMV:

jWSMV is easily built from source code using GNU make. But, you must first
modify the file "customize.mk" to tailor the build to your environment. Simply
follow the instructions documented in the file.

After editing the customization file, build the default (all) target from the
components/ directory. This will create a default distribution of the product
in components/winrs/dist.

For an expedited re-build (i.e., if you have only made a simple change in a few
.java source files), you can use the "rebuild" target in the components
directory.
